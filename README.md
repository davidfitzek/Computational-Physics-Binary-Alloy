# Computational-Physics-Binary-Alloy

In this work we will take a look at an Ising-model like model of a binary alloy of copper and zinc atoms. 

We will see how different properties of this alloy depend on the temperature of the system, which determines the mobility of the particles.

For a more detailed description see the Binary alloy pdf file.
