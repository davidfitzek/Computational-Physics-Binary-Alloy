# Computational-Physics-Binary-Alloy

In this work we are going to investigate static properties of aluminum-particles in a molecular dynamics simulation. 

256 particles are placed on a 3d grid with spacing a0 in a box with periodic boundary conditions.

For a more detailed description see the Binary alloy pdf file.
